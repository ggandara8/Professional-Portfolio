# Professional-Portfolio

  Here you will find a mobile responsive Portfolio web page that will render on a variety of devices and screen sizes. I have created 3 html files called index.html, portfolio.html and contact.html along with 3 different CCS files called style.css, style2.css and style3.css. 

My Portfolio contains the following items:
•	A navabar
•	A responsive layout
•	A responsive layout 
•	A footer
  
  I created this Portfolio representing a little bit of who I am and where I come from. Every page contains an image of a place in my home island Puerto Rico (In the footer I give credit to the artist and it also acts as a link). I’ve only been in Texas for less than a year and Puerto Rico means a lot to me and that’s why I decided to create a clean light background and have the images take the spotlight. I hope you enjoy my page as much as I enjoyed making it and if you have any tips or comments feel to contact me using the Contact page on the html.
